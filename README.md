Description and Philosophy behind "The DAO Funds"

## The DAO FUNDS
------------------------
Wall St. making
"Mutual Funds" for
CryptoCurrencies?
## That is just REDUNDANT!
------------------------
We want people to have an easy way to be well diversified for both long term growth and mid term speculation in sectors of the TOKEN ECONOMY. We want you to be able to buy and forget until retirement, like a Roth IRA, 401K or Index Fund. 

We want the investors in the DAO FUNDS to be able to guide the investments and diversification catagories of their DAO FUNDS using the marketplace to create the DAO FUNDS it wants to invest in. 

# DECENTRALIZATION AND AUTONOMY AT ITS BEST!!!

TheDAOFamily of Funds is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that makes diversifying one's personal portfolio of cryptocurrencies easier than purchasing shares of a mutual fund in the Fiat World... and you even get Governance Control over your Investment.

Holders of our Governance Tokens can propose and vote on creating New INDEX and SECTOR Funds (like the ones below). In addition, holders of the individual Fund Tokens also get a Governance Vote over which Tokens that individual Fund holds in its cryptocurrency portfolio.

# 100% DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE
# RESEARCH THESE EXISTING FUNDS
